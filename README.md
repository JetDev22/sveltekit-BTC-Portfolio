# BTC Portfolio Dashboard
Track your Bitcoin journey quickly and privately.

# Background
I wanted a quick way to track my Bitcoin portfolio data without having to log in somewhere all the time. So I initially created this dashboard using React ([React BTC Dashboard](https://github.com/JetDev22/react-btc-portfolio)).

To be honest I am not the biggest fan of React and started looking for alternatives. This is when I found out about sveltekit. So obviously I used my dashboard idea for my first sveltekit project.
